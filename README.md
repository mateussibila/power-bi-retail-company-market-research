# Marketing Campaign Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to the **Marketing Campaign Analysis Project** repository!  
This project presents a business intelligence solution built with **Power BI, Power Query and DAX**, focused on analyzing marketing and customer data through interactive dashboards.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a business intelligence case study for a market research firm working with a retail company in the food and beverage sector. The objective is to analyze marketing and customer data to understand campaign performance, product sales, and customer profiles.

The dashboard provides visibility into marketing trends, supporting data-driven decisions and highlighting patterns in campaign effectiveness, product performance, and customer behavior.  
It addresses key business questions such as:

- How are recent marketing campaigns performing?  
- Which products generate the most revenue?  
- Who are the main customers?  
- What factors influence campaign performance and purchase behavior?

---

## 📊 Data

The project is based on the following datasets:

- `research_data.csv`  
- `research_data_dictionary.csv`

These files contain customer demographics, product information, sales data, and campaign attribution.

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation & Modeling

Data preparation and modeling were performed using **Power Query**.

The ETL process included data inspection, column standardization, data type adjustments, handling typos or inconsistent values, and creation of referenced queries for analysis.

An **analytical data model** was then built by merging tables and applying **dimensional modeling** principles, defining fact and dimension tables, establishing relationships, and validating cardinality.

This process ensured a clean, consistent, and well-structured semantic layer for the dashboard.

## 📈 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into three main analytical sections:

### 1. Campaign & Product Performance
Provides a comparative view of campaigns by purchase volume, revenue, product mix, and sales channels, highlighting which campaigns and platforms drive the most sales.

### 2. Customer Profile
Analyzes customer demographics and behavior, linking attributes such as education, income, age, and marital status to purchasing patterns and segmentation.

### 3. Purchase Drivers
Uses **Key Influencers** analysis to uncover factors impacting campaign acceptance and sales, allowing dynamic filtering by product category to explore performance drivers.
