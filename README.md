# Marketing Campaign Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to the **Marketing Campaign Analysis Project** repository!  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end business intelligence solution using **Power BI, Power Query and DAX**, focused on transforming marketing and customer data into actionable insights.  
Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights best practices in data preparation, analytical modeling, and data visualization.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a business intelligence case study for a market research firm working with a retail company in the food and beverage sector. The objective is to analyze marketing and customer data in order to better understand campaign performance, product sales, and customer profiles.

The client is a small company that is still exploring its market and learning about customer behavior. Therefore, the main goal of this dashboard is to transform raw marketing data into actionable insights that support business decision-making.

The dashboard focuses on answering key business questions such as:
- How are recent marketing campaigns performing?
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- Who are the main customers?
- What factors influence campaign performance and purchase behavior?

## 📊 Data

The project is based on the following datasets:

- `research_data.csv`  
- `research_data_dictionary.csv`

These files contain customer demographics, product information, sales data, and campaign attribution.

## 🔄 Data Preparation

Data preparation was performed using **Power Query**, including:

- Importing and inspecting raw data  
- Renaming columns for clarity  
- Adjusting data types  
- Handling typos and inconsistent values  
- Creating referenced tables for analysis  

These steps ensured data quality and consistency before building the analytical model and visualizations.

## 📈 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into three main analytical sections:

### 1. Campaign & Product Performance
This section provides a comparative view of marketing campaigns in terms of purchase volume, revenue, product mix, and sales channels. It allows users to identify which campaigns generate the highest financial return, how revenue is distributed across product categories, and which platforms (store, web, catalog, deal) drive most sales.

### 2. Customer Profile
This section focuses on understanding customer demographics and behavior. It highlights key characteristics such as education level, marital status, income, age, and household composition, and links them to purchasing patterns. This enables segmentation analysis and helps identify how different customer groups respond to campaigns.

### 3. Purchase Drivers
This section uses automated **Key Influencers** analysis to uncover which factors most impact campaign acceptance and total sales. Users can dynamically filter by product categories to explore what drives performance and simulate different business scenarios, supporting more informed strategic decisions.
